# Botanica Algorithmica

Botanica Algorithmica is a procedural plant generation application that uses L-systems to simulate the growth and development of plants. With an intuitive interface, users can manipulate various parameters to create unique and intricate botanical structures.

## Features

- **Procedural Generation**: Create endless varieties of plants using algorithmic growth patterns.
- **Customization**: Adjust branch width, leaf size, stem color, and more to refine your plant designs.
- **Save & Load**: Save your creations and revisit them anytime.
- **Development Visualization**: Watch your plants grow from seedling to full bloom.
- **Predefined Presets**: Jumpstart your creativity with built-in plant presets.

## Example Plants

Check out the `SavedPlants` folder for examples of plants generated with Botanica Algorithmica.
